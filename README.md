# Automation API Testing with Pytest for Bookstore API

**Description**: This repository contains an automation framework for API testing using Python and Pytest, designed to validate and ensure the functionality of a dummy Bookstore API. It demonstrates best practices in API testing by covering various test scenarios such as user authentication, data validation, and error handling.

Comprehensive Test Coverage:
- Authentication tests (e.g., login, token generation, user details).
- Validation for uncommon HTTP status codes (e.g., 500, 429).

Getting Started:
1. Clone the Repository:

       git clone https://github.com/ZulvikaK/pytest-api-bookstore.git
       cd pytest-api-bookstore
2. Install Pytest:
Install Pytest using pip, the Python package manager:

       pip install pytest

3. Install dependencies:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the test
   Execute the test suite using Pytest:

       pytest

**Purpose**: This project serves as a reference for implementing a robust and scalable API testing framework. It is ideal for learning and demonstrating API testing principles in a real-world scenario using dummy APIs.
